Let's talk a little bit about my project, or should I say, our project: Me, Habiba, Arwa, and Yousef. We're a team together in Amideast. The sole purpose of this project is to try to make a Course Admin website, provided with a real-looking database and a respectable front-end work.
Up to now, 21/8/2024 14:28, what I intend to publish is my database of our project.
Note 23/8/2024: I decided to upload the MVC project, too. The database hasn't been uploaded because of many reasons: that I have to install some source control and another MS product to be able to share it.
